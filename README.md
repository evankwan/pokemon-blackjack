### About

A Blackjack game with a Pok√©mon twist. A virtual card game that pits the player versus the dealer. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer. This can be accomplished by getting Blackjack (your first two cards have a score of 21) or by getting a final score that that is higher than the dealer's score without exceeding 21. In essence, you want to get as close to 21 as possible. 

As you win more hands, your Pok√©mon will evolve!

  * On each hand, you are betting 100 XP points. Each hand won returns 100 XP, (unless you have doubled down, if returns).

* **Card Score:** 
  * The value (score) of your hand show below youre cards and above the dealer's cards.
  * Cards are counted as their respective numbers, face cards as ten, and ace as either eleven or one.

* **Hit:** 
  * This gives you another card from the deck.
  * Adding a new card will increase your card count.

* **Stand:** 
  * If your final card count has exceeded 21, you have "busted".

* **Double:**
  * Allows the player the option to double their wager (an additional 100XP in this case for a total of 200 XP on the hand).
  * This action can only be done once.
  * Upon doubling, your hand will be give one more final card.
  * If you win the hand, you will recieve double your wager.

* **Bust:**
  * Keep the cards you have and proceed with the round.
  * When you or the dealer goes bust it means that the value of the hand went over twenty-one. 
  * When you bust you lose.
  * If you have not already busted, when the dealer busts, you will win.

* **Blackjack:**
  * If a player or dealer's first two cards amount to a card count of 21, this is known as a "Blackjack".
  * The round is immediately over, and your wager is surrendered, if the dealer is dealt a "Blackjack".
  * If a player gets "Blackjack", they get 2.5x the initial wager.

* **Pok√©mon evolve:**
  * Each Pok√©mon can evolve twice!
  * The evolution happens at the 1500XP and 2000XP levels.
